**IMPORTANT** - The starting codebases for 2022 have been lost to history, only the scenarios are available and as such it might not be possible to try them out but they'll be enough to get an idea of how the challenges were in the past.

### Solutions
 
From 2023 onwards, all successful solutions by participating teams along with the initial solution by SLIIT FOSS have been added under the `solutions` folder.
