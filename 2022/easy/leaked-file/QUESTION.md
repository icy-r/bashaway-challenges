# Leaked file

Chuti Ayya is doing a study session for his little brother and his friends. For this, he has prepared some resource files and has them stored in multiple ZIP files.

Chuti Ayya is very forgetful. So he stores all of his passwords in a file named password.txt .

Here's the kicker, Chuti Ayya realized he has accidently stored the password.txt in one of the ZIP files. He is asking for your help in resolving this situation.

# Task
Copy every ZIP file except the ZIP file that includes the password.txt file; to the 'Output' directory.

# Input format
In the Input directory, you will be given multiple ZIP files. One of which, includes the password.txt file.

# Output format
The Output directory should have every ZIP file, except the ZIP file that includes password.txt
